# SPEC-1-Permit Package Manager (Cross-Platform & Cloud-Backed)

## Background
Managing construction permit packages across devices is inefficient. This solution provides:
- Native apps (iOS, Android, Windows, Linux)
- Cloud (AWS) or self-hosted (Docker) backend
- File storage, offline sync, county-specific checklists

## Requirements
### Must Have
- Native apps
- Cloud or self-hosted backend
- Permit checklists tied to counties
- File storage and sync

### Should Have
- Web interface

### Could Have
- Document previews

## Method



## Implementation
- Database schema (PostgreSQL/DynamoDB)
- API design (CRUD + Auth + File Upload)
- Docker Compose setup
- Seed scripts for counties & checklists

## Milestones
| Milestone | Task | Time |
|-----------|------|------|
| M1 | Lock requirements | 1 week |
| M2 | Backend setup | 2 weeks |
| M3 | Frontend (1 platform) | 2-3 weeks |
| M4 | File uploads | 1 week |
| M5 | Offline/sync | 2 weeks |
| M6 | Testing & MVP | 1-2 weeks |

## Gathering Results
- Check correctness, sync, storage, and deployment flexibility.
